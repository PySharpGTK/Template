PySharpGTK - Because I hate whoever decided that WinForms are needed in this course

  </div>
 

![1  Amplication main](https://github.com/PySharpGTK/Template/blob/main/Artboarda.png?raw=true)

PySharpGTK is a simple project, it lets people create GTK GUI using C# while handling the rest, it then creates a fake WinForms layout for - my professor to grade it on Windows. The current goal is to mimic the syntax and functionality provided by WinForms.

# Features
PySharpGTK supports the following:

- Entry, Labels, Buttons
- Event driven controls
- On-typing bindings
- Python service management
- Actual cross-platform support ... unlike WinForms

# Getting Started

WIP! Currently only Linux machines are supported, we are looking into MacOS support but it may take a week or so..
